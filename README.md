404 error, change return argument from username=username to username=session["user"]

bugfix upvoting/downvoting - redirect rather than render template

first term in list showing up in confirmation box rather than target term. Fixed by giving each modal div a unique id of id="{{ term._id }}" and setting href accordingly - href="#{{ term._id }}"

{% if session.user and session.user|lower != term.created_by|lower or session.user|lower == "admin"|lower %}
prevents users voting on their own content unless they are an admin.
